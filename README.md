# Recommendation
The total operating profit for the years 2020 and 2021 is $332,134,761.

West Gear performed the best during this period, with total sales of $242,964,333 and an operating profit of $85,667,873. Walmart performed the least, with total sales of $74,558,410 and an operating profit of $25,782,053. Walmart should implement a well-detailed sales promotion strategy, invest in advertising, and establish a stronger online presence to boost sales.

Amazon sold the lowest number of products.

The West region recorded the highest operating profit of $89,609,407, while the Mid-West had the lowest at $52,811,346. The West region remains our primary market, and we must take all necessary steps to retain our customer base. Occasional discounts could further boost sales.

The highest number of units sold came from online sales, totaling 939,093 units. We must continue to strengthen our online presence. Improving our delivery services will make it easier for customers to patronize us online. Regular website maintenance is also essential to keep up with digital trends.

The best-performing product of the year is Men’s Street Footwear, which generated $82,802,261 in operating profit. In contrast, the least-performing product is Women’s Athletic Footwear, with an operating profit of $38,975,785. I recommend that stakeholders instruct all inventory staff to monitor Women’s Apparel and Men’s Street Footwear closely in the coming year to avoid stock depletion.

Stakeholders should offer incentives to retailers for their hard work. This will serve as a form of recognition and motivation, encouraging better performance in the following year. The best-performing region and retailer should be acknowledged, as this recognition could foster healthy competition among other regions and retailers, ultimately increasing overall operating profits.
